C: The fastest among all due to:

Low-level memory access.

Minimal runtime overhead.

Highly efficient system calls and buffer management.

C++: Slightly slower than C but still very fast:

Has some additional abstractions compared to C.

Uses efficient I/O streams and string manipulation.

Java: Moderately fast, but slower than C/C++ because:

Runs on JVM, adding some overhead.

Has optimized libraries but with garbage collection pauses.

Just-in-time compilation helps, but still can't match native C.

R: Slower than the above languages:

Designed for statistical computing, not for file manipulation.

Interpreted language with overhead in string handling.

Often needs external libraries or calls to C code for speed.

Python: The slowest in the group due to:

High-level language with dynamic typing.

Interpreted with GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) affecting concurrency.

String operations are slower compared to compiled languages
